# rendezvous
A small space game!

Rendezvous is a tiny space game in which you control a spacecraft in orbit around a planet. The goal of the game is to use your limited propellant to rendezvous with a target object which is also in orbit around the planet. To achieve this, you have to alter your orbit to meet the target, dodge potential hazards and watch your differential speed to the target.


Controls are as follows:

Left/Right Arrow Keys: Simulation speed decrease/increase

Up/Down Arrow Keys: Thrust direction lock mode switching (Prograde/Retrograde/No lock)

Mouse scrolling and left click: Camera zoom and translation

Spacebar: Toggle Player and Target orbit ellipse display


How to run:

1.) Download all files

2.) Run rendezvous.py
